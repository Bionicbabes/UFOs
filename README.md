# **UFOs**

## **Overview of Project:**

- **Background**

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

- **Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria**

Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape,

# **Results:**

-------------------------------

- We have set up the webpage in a way that the search result will take effect only after a value has been changed within the text box field.  To do this you click within the search category text box that you desire and using the example (all searches are case sensitive) you input the filtering data.  You may notice that when you enter the data that it does on modifiy the data table right away.  You must click outside the text box from which you entered the data for the value to be inputed as a search value and to pull the data.  You can also press the "Enter" key on your key board after entering in the value into the category text box and this will return a modified data table.

# **Summary:**

-------------------------------

## **Drawbacks**

- This is a very simple webpage but it has lots of limitations.  The webpage is local and can only be used if the user has all associated app.js, data.js, style.css, and index.html files on their computer.  This webpage could also be a lot more user friendly, the user really has to understand how to work the webpage which in somewhat intuitive but there could be some improvements to help the user better navigate the webpage. 

## **Improvements**

- Two improvements to make this more user friendly would be to add a more buttons.  After entering in all the search requirement you could add a button at the bottom that would use all the inputs and perform the search.  Also after the button was clicked all the category fields would be deleted for a new entry.  Another button I would put in place is a clear all search results and return the original data set.  This is a little more intuitive using the buttons this way.

- Another improvement that i would make is to add try and expect code within the function.  If the user does not enter in the correct matching data into the text fields then a null result is show with and empty data table.  You can set the error message so they know how they have inputted the data wrong.
