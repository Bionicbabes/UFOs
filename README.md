# **UFOs**

## **Overview of Project:**

- **Background**

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

- **Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria**

Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape,

## **Results:**

-------------------------------

We have set up the webpage in a way that the search result will take effect after a value has been changed within the text box field.  To do this you click within the search category text box that you desire and using the example (all searches are case sensitive) you input the filtering data.  You may notice that when you enter the data that it does on modifiy the data table right away.  You must click outside the text box from which you entered the data for the value to be inputed as a search value and to pull the data.
